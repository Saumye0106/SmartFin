## 🔑 Key Concepts Explained

### Microservices Architecture
**Simple explanation:** Instead of one big application doing everything, we split it into many small applications that each do one thing really well.
**Analogy:** Like having specialized workers (chef, waiter, cashier) instead of one person doing all jobs in a restaurant.

### AI/ML Enhancement
**Simple explanation:** Adding artificial intelligence to make the app smarter and more helpful.
**Analogy:** Like upgrading from a basic calculator to a smart financial advisor that learns and gives personalized advice.

### Design-First Approach
**Simple explanation:** Design how features should look and work before writing any code.
**Analogy:** Like creating architectural blueprints before building a house.

### Component-Driven Development
**Simple explanation:** Building reusable pieces of user interface that can be combined in different ways.
**Analogy:** Like LEGO blocks - create standard pieces that can be assembled into different structures.
